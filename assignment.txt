1. NumPy
Purpose: Numerical computing.

Description: NumPy is the foundational package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. Itâ€™s essential for performing numerical computations and serves as the basis for many other libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more.
Key Features:
N-dimensional array object (ndarray)
Broadcasting functions
Linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

2. Pandas
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.

Description: Pandas is built on top of NumPy and provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly. It offers tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.
Key Features:
DataFrame: 2-dimensional labeled data structure
Series: 1-dimensional labeled data structure
Powerful data alignment and handling of missing data
Reshaping, merging, and joining of datasets
Time series-specific functionality

3. Scikit-learn
Purpose: Machine learning.

Description: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. It offers simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis and is accessible to everyone and reusable in various contexts.
Key Features:
Classification, regression, and clustering algorithms (e.g., SVM, random forest, k-means)
Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, feature selection)
Model selection and evaluation (e.g., cross-validation, metrics)
Preprocessing utilities (e.g., standardization, normalization)

4. TensorFlow
Purpose: Machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Description: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning developed by Google. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
Key Features:
Robust support for building and training deep learning models
TensorBoard for visualizing the model training process
TensorFlow Serving for deploying models
TensorFlow Lite for mobile and embedded devices
TensorFlow.js for running models in the browser

5. Keras
Purpose: High-level neural networks API.

Description: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. It allows for easy and fast prototyping, supports both convolutional and recurrent networks, and runs seamlessly on CPUs and GPUs.
Key Features:
User-friendly and modular
Supports convolutional networks (for image processing) and recurrent networks (for sequence processing)
Built-in support for multi-GPU and distributed training
Simple and consistent interface optimized for common use cases

6. PyTorch
Purpose: Deep learning.

Description: PyTorch is an open-source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment. Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, it is known for its dynamic computation graph and intuitive interface.
Key Features:
Dynamic computation graph (define-by-run) which makes debugging easier and more intuitive
Strong support for automatic differentiation via Autograd
Rich ecosystem with libraries like torchvision, torchaudio, and torchtext
Integration with Python for easier development and debugging
Optimized for performance with support for distributed training and deployment on cloud platforms
